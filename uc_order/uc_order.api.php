/**
 * Defines line items that are attached to orders.
 *
 * A line item is a representation of charges, fees, and totals for an order.
 * Default line items include the subtotal and total line items, the tax line
 * item, and the shipping line item. There is also a generic line item that
 * store admins can use to add extra fees and discounts to manually created
 * orders. Module developers will use this hook to define new types of line
 * items for their stores. An example use would be for a module that allows
 * customers to use coupons and wants to represent an entered coupon as a line
 * item.
 *
 * Once a line item has been defined in hook_uc_line_item, Ubercart will begin
 * interacting with it in various parts of the code. One of the primary ways
 * this is done is through the callback function you specify for the line item.
 *
 * @return
 *   Your hook should return an array of associative arrays. Each item in the
 *   array represents a single line item, keyed by the internal ID of the line
 *   item, and with the following members:
 *   - "title"
 *     - type: string
 *     - value: The title of the line item shown to the user in various
 *       interfaces. Use t().
 *   - "callback"
 *     - type: string
 *     - value: Name of the line item's callback function, called for various
 *       operations.
 *   - "weight"
 *     - type: integer
 *     - value: Display order of the line item in lists; "lighter" items are
 *       displayed first.
 *   - "stored"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not the line item will be stored in the database.
 *       Should be TRUE for any line item that is modifiable from the order
 *       edit screen.
 *   - "add_list"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not a line item should be included in the "Add a Line
 *       Item" select box on the order edit screen.
 *   - "calculated"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not the value of this line item should be added to
 *       the order total. (Ex: would be TRUE for a shipping charge line item but
 *       FALSE for the subtotal line item since the product prices are already
 *       taken into account.)
 *   - "display_only"
 *     - type: boolean
 *     - value: Whether or not this line item is simply a display of information
 *       but not calculated anywhere. (Ex: the total line item uses display to
 *       simply show the total of the order at the bottom of the list of line
 *       items.)

/**
 * Performs actions on orders.
 *
 * An order in Ubercart represents a single transaction. Orders are created
 * during the checkout process where they sit in the database with a status of
 * "In checkout". When a customer completes checkout, the order's status gets
 * updated to show that the sale has gone through. Once an order is created,
 * and even during its creation, it may be acted on by any module to connect
 * extra information to an order. Every time an action occurs to an order,
 * hook_uc_order() gets invoked to let your modules know what's happening and
 * make stuff happen.
 *
 * @param $op
 *   The action being performed.
 * @param $order
 *   This is the order object.
 * @param $arg2
 *   This is variable and is based on the value of $op:
 *   - new: Called when an order is created. $order is a reference to the new
 *     order object, so modules may add to or modify the order at creation.
 *   - presave: Before an order object is saved, the hook gets invoked with this
 *     op to let other modules alter order data before it is written to the
 *     database. $order is a reference to the order object.
 *   - save: When an order object is being saved, the hook gets invoked with
 *     this op to let other modules do any necessary saving. $order is a
 *     reference to the order object.
 *   - load: Called when an order is loaded after the order and product data has
 *     been loaded from the database. Passes $order as the reference to the
 *     order object, so modules may add to or modify the order object when it's
 *     loaded.
 *   - submit: When a sale is being completed and the customer has clicked the
 *     Submit order button from the checkout screen, the hook is invoked with
 *     this op. This gives modules a chance to determine whether or not the
 *     order should be allowed. An example use of this is the credit module
 *     attempting to process payments when an order is submitted and returning
 *     a failure message if the payment failed.
 *     To prevent an order from passing through, you must return an array
 *     resembling the following one with the failure message:
 * @code
 *       return array(array(
 *         'pass' => FALSE,
 *         'message' => t('We were unable to process your credit card.'),
 *       ));
 * @endcode
 *   - can_update: Called before an order's status is changed to make sure the
 *     order can be updated. $order is the order object with the old order
 *     status ID ($order->order_status), and $arg2 is simply the new order
 *     status ID. Return FALSE to stop the update for some reason.
 *   - update: Called when an order's status is changed. $order is the order
 *     object with the old order status ID ($order->order_status), and $arg2 is
 *     the new order status ID.
 *   - can_delete: Called before an order is deleted to verify that the order
 *     may be deleted. Returning FALSE will prevent a delete from happening.
 *     (For example, the payment module returns FALSE by default when an order
 *     has already received payments.)
 *   - delete: Called when an order is deleted and before the rest of the order
 *     information is removed from the database. Passes $order as the order
 *     object to let your module clean up it's tables.
 *   - total: Called when the total for an order is being calculated after the
 *     total of the products has been added. Passes $order as the order object.
 *     Expects in return a value (positive or negative) by which to modify the
 *     order total.

 * on the order screens.

 * information about what parts of an order pane are defined by the hook.

 *     - type: string
 *     - value: A short description of the pane for the admin pages.
 *   - class:
 *     - type: string
 *     - value: A CSS class that determines the relative position of the pane's
 *       div. Choose "pos-left" to float left against the previous pane or
 *       "abs-left" to start a new line of panes.
